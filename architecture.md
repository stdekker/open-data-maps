# Application Architecture

The aim for this application is to be easy to deploy on shared hosting webservers. Most of them have a classic LAMP stack. And users are not allowed to install software. Therefore ODM is buit without npm, node, webpack or advanced database tools. The aim is also to make the code easy to understand and modify.

## Directory Structure 

The application is organized into the following main directories:

- `web/`: Contains the frontend application and PHP data api
- `tools/`: Contains PHP scripts for data processing
- `process/`: Contains additional processing scripts
- `vendor/`: Composer dependencies
- `.ddev/`: DDEV configuration for local development

### Web Directory Structure

- `web/src/`: Frontend JavaScript source code
- `web/content/`: Content files
- `web/css/` and `web/style/`: Stylesheets
- `web/api/`: Backend API endpoints
- `web/data/`: Data files
